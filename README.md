# PELMA
    PELMA - Python Event Loop Manager

# Project Goals
   * In this project, i will implement a fully functioning Event Loop Manager(ELMA)      Library in python. 
   * Python applications can leverage ELMA interface to develop embedded applications    and specifically for running event loops.
   * We will use events for Interprocess communication.

   I will consider this project to be successful if:
   * A Python client can use this library to define processes.
   * A Python client can use this library to schedule processes to run at a certain      frequency.
   * A Python client use this library communicate between processes via events.
   * A Python client can build a Finite State Machine using PELMA library.

   We will build a simple test robot finite state machine using the PELMA library.

# Resources
   * Pluralsight course Python Fundamentals
   * Will use C++ Elma API's used in this course as a reference
   * Unit Test for hw_7, for building test robot finite state machine.
