P\+E\+L\+MA -\/ Python Event Loop Manager

\section*{Project Goals}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item In this project, i will implement a fully functioning Event Loop Manager(\+E\+L\+M\+A) Library in python.
\item Python applications can leverage E\+L\+MA interface to develop embedded applications and specifically for running event loops.
\item We will use events for Interprocess communication.
\end{DoxyItemize}

I will consider this project to be successful if\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A Python client can use this library to define processes.
\item A Python client can use this library to schedule processes to run at a certain frequency.
\item A Python client use this library communicate between processes via events.
\item A Python client can build a Finite State Machine using P\+E\+L\+MA library.
\end{DoxyItemize}

We will build a simple test robot finite state machine using the P\+E\+L\+MA library.

\section*{Resources}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Pluralsight course Python Fundamentals
\item Py\+Charm I\+DE for Python
\item Will use C++ elma A\+PI\textquotesingle{}s used in this course as a reference
\item Unit Test for hw\+\_\+7, for building test robot finite state machine.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{Current Accomplishments}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Completed requirement analysis, design in python and scoping
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Dockerized the python Elma App
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Implemented some of the the core Elma A\+P\+Is -\/ Manager, Process and Event classes in Python
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Added a test for some of the core A\+P\+Is in Process and Manager
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\section*{Code implemented so far}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Created a new package elma.\+api to hold all the E\+L\+MA classes.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item We have implemented Manger, Process, Event classes in event.\+py, manager.\+py and process.\+py
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Test has been added under the package elma.\+test
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsection*{Installation }

\begin{DoxyVerb}git clone https://github.com/ashikaro/Elma.git
cd Elma
make build
make run
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsection*{Execution }

To run the test process once in the container, type \begin{DoxyVerb}python -m unittest
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsection*{Testing }

To run tests, do 
\begin{DoxyCode}
python -m unittest
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Architecture }

Describe how your project was designed, what choices you made, how things are organized, etc.
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item This project is designed to work as an E\+L\+MA python library which can be published to a artifactory and embedded appications can add this as a dependency to incorporate E\+L\+MA into their system.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item All the core E\+L\+MA classes Manger, Process, Event behave functionally the same way as the C++ E\+L\+MA we have built in this class.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item As a proof concept to test if E\+L\+MA can be used in Embedded apps, we have implemented a simple robot which leverage the E\+L\+MA A\+P\+Is to perform simple operations similar to the assignment 7 \subsection*{Results }
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Describe the results of testing and running your code. Include visuals when possible.
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item We have written a test for core functionality of the process.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
